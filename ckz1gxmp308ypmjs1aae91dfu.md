## Tip for your hashnode articles

Recently, I got myself into trouble. 

What really happened was I posted an article in hashnode.

 When I clicked the article, instead of opening the recently published article, another article which was published 24 days earlier, opened.

I was worried and anxious as I did not find that article even in ***Posts*** section. Thankfully, I retrieved that article after a day.

I started looking into hashnode to ensure that such things never happened again. 

And to my amazement, I discovered that there is an option to backup our articles on Github automatically.

> TBH, I would have never seen this option if I had not faced this issue.

#### ðŸš€ Steps to enable ***Backup*** option
- Open up your blog and then click on the icon called *** Blog Dashboard*** which is on the left of your profile picture.

- On clicking the icon, you will get a page exactly like the very first image which is on the top.
- Click on the ***Backup.*** Then you will be provided information on how to enable the backup option. Do as it says and VoilÃ , you are done.
- After enabled, you will see this.

And it's done. What an easy way to backup our articles. 

Thanks to hashnode and thanks a lot to you for reading this out.
